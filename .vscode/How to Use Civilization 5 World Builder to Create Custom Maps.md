## Downloading Civilization 5 World Builder
 
The first step is to download Civilization 5 World Builder from Steam. To do this, you need to have Civilization 5 installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Steam and go to the 'Tools' section of your games library.
2. Find Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK and install it.
3. Once the download is finished, you can launch the SDK from this menu.
4. On the pop up menu, select 'WorldBuilder' to open the map editor.

## Creating a New Map
 
Once you have opened WorldBuilder, you can start creating your own map. You have two options: you can either generate a blank map or a random map with some terrain features. Here's how to do both:
 
### Generating a Blank Map
 
If you want to start from scratch, you can generate a blank map with only water tiles. To do this:

1. Use the two sliders at the top left of the screen to adjust the size of your map (x and y axis).
2. Press the 'Generate Blank Map' button to see your resized map in the main view.
3. Press 'Accept Map' to proceed to the main editor.

### Generating a Random Map
 
If you want to have some terrain features already generated for you, you can use the random map option. To do this:

1. Use the drop down menu at the bottom left of the screen to select the type of world you want (e.g. Archipelago, Ice Age, etc.).
2. Use the other drop down menus below to adjust other aspects of your world, such as age, rainfall, and sea level.
3. Press the grey 'Generate with...' button to see what the editor creates.
4. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can press the button again until you get something you like.
5. Press 'Accept Map' to proceed to the main editor.

## Editing Your Map
 
Now that you have your map ready, you can start editing it to your liking. You can use various tools and options to modify the terrain, add resources, place civilizations, and more. Here are some of the things you can do:
 
### Painting Terrain
 
The easiest way to create your world is using the 'paint' tab at the top right of the screen. This lets you paint tiles onto the map with different terrain types. To do this:

1. Select the 'paint' tab and make sure the 'Terrain' pip is checked in the list of options below.
2. Use the drop down menu below 'Terrain' to select anything from grassland to mountains.
3. Set the size and shape of your brush with the top two options.
4. Paint your map into existence in the main view by clicking and dragging on tiles.

### Adding Resources
 
You can also add resources to your map using the 'paint' tab. Resources are things like gold, iron, wheat, etc. that provide benefits to civilizations that control them. To do this:

1. Select the 'paint' tab and make sure the 'Resource' pip is checked in the list of options below.
2. Use the drop down menu below 'Resource' to select any resource you want.
3. Set the size and shape of your brush with the top two options.
4. Add resources to your map by clicking and dragging on tiles.

### Placing Civilizations
  
You can also place civilizations on your map using the 'Player' tab at the top right of the screen. Civilizations are controlled
